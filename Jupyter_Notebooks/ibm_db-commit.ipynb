    "The __ibm_db.commit()__ API is used to terminate an in-progress transaction and apply all changes that were made by that transaction to the database. (A *transaction* is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are grouped together as a single process; when a transaction is committed, the effects of all operations that were performed by the transaction are made permanent.) Normally, a transaction is initiated the first time an SQL statement is executed after a database connection is established or an in-progress transaction ends. But, with Python applications, each SQL operation is treated as a transaction that is implicitly committed as soon as it completes unless __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior is turned __OFF__. Consequently, the __ibm_db.commit()__ API has no effect when __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior is __ON__ (the default).<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if the connection being used is a persistent connection (i.e., a connection that was established with the __ibm_db.pconnect()__ API), in-progress transactions for *<u>all applications using the connection will be rolled back when this API is called</u>*. For this reason, the use of persistent connections is not recommended for applications that need to control transaction boundaries."
