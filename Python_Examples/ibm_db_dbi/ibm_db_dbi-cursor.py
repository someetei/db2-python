#  NAME:     ibm_db_dbi-cursor.py                                                                 #
#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the .cursor() function of the      #
#            IBM_DBConnection object that is returned by the ibm_db_dbi.connect() API.            #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db_dbi-cursor.py                                                               #
#                                                                                                 #
