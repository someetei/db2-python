#  NAME:     ibm_db_dbi-callproc.py                                                               #
#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the .callproc() function of the    #
#            cursor object associated with the IBM_DBConnection object returned by the            #
#            ibm_db_dbi.connect() API.                                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db_dbi-callproc.py                                                             #
#                                                                                                 #
