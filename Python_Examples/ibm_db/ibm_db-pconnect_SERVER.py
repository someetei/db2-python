#  NAME:     ibm_db-pconnect_SERVER.py                                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.pconnect() API to       #
#            create a pool of connections to a remote Db2 server.                                 #
#                                                                                                 #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.createdbNX()                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.close()                                                                  #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db-pconnect_SERVER.py                                                          #
#                                                                                                 #
