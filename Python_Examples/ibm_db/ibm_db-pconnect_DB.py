#  NAME:     ibm_db-pconnect_DB.py                                                                #
#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.pconnect() API to       #
#            create a pool of connections to a local Db2 database.                                #
#                                                                                                 #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.exec_immediate()                                                         #
#                 ibm_db.num_rows()                                                               #
#                 ibm_db.close()                                                                  #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db-pconnect_DB.py                                                              #
#                                                                                                 #
