#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db-num_rows() API.         #
#                                                                                                 #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.autocommit()                                                             #
#                 ibm_db.prepare()                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.exec_many()                                                              #
#                 ibm_db.exec_rollback()                                                          #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db-num_rows.py                                                                 #
#                                                                                                 #
