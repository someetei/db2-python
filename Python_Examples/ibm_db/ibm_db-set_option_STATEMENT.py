#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.set_option() API to     #
#            assign a value to one of the statement options available.                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.prepare()                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.execute()                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.num_rows()                                                               #

#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db-get_option_STATEMENT.py                                                     #
#                                                                                                 #
