#  NAME:     ibm_db-dropdb_LOCAL.py                                                               #
#                                                                                                 #
#  PURPOSE:  This program is designed to illustrate how to use the ibm_db.dropdb() API to delete  #
#            (drop) a local Db2 database.                                                         #
#                                                                                                 #
#            Additional APIs used:                                                                #
#                 ibm_db.conn_errormsg()                                                          #
#                                                                                                 #
#  USAGE:    Log in as a Db2 database instance user (for example, db2inst1) and issue the         #
#            following command from a terminal window:                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
#            ./ibm_db-dropdb_REMOTE.py                                                            #
#                                                                                                 #
